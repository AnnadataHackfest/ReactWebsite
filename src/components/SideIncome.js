            <h1>Horticulture</h1>
            <p>Horticulture is the art of cultivating plants in gardens to produce food and medicinal ingredients, or for comfort and ornamental purposes. Horticulturists grow flowers, fruits and nuts, vegetables and herbs, as well as ornamental trees and lawns.
Historically, the study and practice of horticulture have been traced back to thousands of years ago; horticulture is known to have contributed to the transition from nomadic human communities to sedentary, or semi-sedentary, horticultural communities.Horticulture is divided 
into several categories which focus on the cultivation and processing of different types of plants and food items for specific purposes. In order to conserve the science of horticulture, multiple organizations worldwide educate, encourage, and promote the advancement of horticulture. 
Some notable horticulturists include Luca Ghini, Luther Burbank, and Tony Avent.<br></br>
Environmental horticulture provides a range of green career paths including in greenhouse production, 
wholesale brokers, commercial nurseries, garden centers, florists and landscape design and construction firms.
There are also green jobs in private and community gardens, municipal parks and state or national reserves.<br></br>
Horticulture is divided into the cultivation of plants for food (pomology and olericulture) and plants for ornament (floriculture and landscape horticulture). Pomology deals with fruit and nut crops. 
Olericulture deals with herbaceous plants for the kitchen, including, for example, carrots (edible root), asparagus (edible stem), lettuce (edible leaf), cauliflower (edible flower buds), tomatoes (edible fruit), and peas (edible seed). 
Floriculture deals with the production of flowers and ornamental plants; generally, cut flowers, pot plants, and greenery. Landscape horticulture is a broad category that includes plants for the landscape, 
including lawn turf but particularly nursery crops such as shrubs, trees, and vines.

            <h1>Animal Husbandry</h1>
            <p>Animal husbandry is the branch of agriculture concerned with animals that are raised for meat, fibre, milk, eggs, or other products. 
            It includes day-to-day care, selective breeding and the raising of livestock. Husbandry has a long history, starting with the Neolithic revolution when animals were first domesticated, from around 13,000 BC onwards, antedating farming of the first crops. 
            By the time of early civilisations such as ancient Egypt, cattle, sheep, goats and pigs were being raised on farms.<br></br>A large number of Indian farmers depend upon animal husbandry for their livelihood. Globally the scope of animal husbandry is quite good. 
            Their are ample jobs in this field like supplying of meat, egg, milk, wool, etc. The animal husbandry plays a vital role in increasing Indian economy. 
            Animal husbandry is the branch of agriculture science. Animal husbandry professionals can run their own farms. You can also find work in more specialized areas. 
            After completing your degree aspirants can work as an advisor to a commercial officer or management officer, you can also work as a relations manager, or entrepreneur, for a dairy cattle farmer.<br></br> 
            Animal husbandry has a significant impact on the world environment. It is responsible for somewhere between 20 and 33% of the fresh water usage in the world,[77] 
            and livestock, and the production of feed for them, occupy about a third of the earth's ice-free land.[78] Livestock production is a contributing factor in species extinction, desertification,[79] 
            and habitat destruction.[80] Animal agriculture contributes to species extinction in various ways. Habitat is destroyed by clearing forests and converting land to grow feed crops and for animal grazing, while predators and herbivores are frequently targeted and hunted because 
            of a perceived threat to livestock profits; for example, animal husbandry is responsible for up to 91% of the deforestation in the Amazon region.[81] In addition, livestock produce greenhouse gases. Cows produce some 570 million cubic metres of methane per day,[82] that accounts for from 35 to 
            40% of the overall methane emissions of the planet.<br></br>
             Livestock is responsible for 65% of all human-related emissions of the powerful and long-lived greenhouse gas nitrous oxide.[83]<br></br>

            <h1>Bee keeping</h1>
            <p>Beekeeping (or apiculture) is the maintenance of bee colonies, commonly in man-made hives, by humans. Most such bees are honey bees in the genus Apis, but other honey-producing bees such as Melipona stingless bees are also kept. 
            A beekeeper (or apiarist) keeps bees in order to collect their honey and other products that the hive produce (including beeswax, propolis, flower pollen, bee pollen, and royal jelly), to pollinate crops, or to produce bees for sale to other beekeepers. 
            A location where bees are kept is called an apiary or "bee yard".<br></br>India today has about eight lakh bee colonies. considering the modem beekeeping which arrived in India only three decades ago with the advent of the Khadi and Village Industries 
            Commission (KVIC), today the number of bee colonies and beekeeper's co- operatives are 8, 10, 807 and 169 respectively. It has made a spectacular achievement. Kerala, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, Himachal Pradesh, Kashmir, Punjab, Meghalaya, Andaman and Nicobar islands are the important states 
            in which beekeeping co-operatives are active.Beekeeping can be a profitable occupation in areas with good floral pasturage. Possibility for the development beekeeping in India is 
            tremendous due to its diverse environment and inexhaustible floral resources obtained from natural vegetation and cultivated crops. According to recent statistics, about 50 million hectares of land is under the cultivation of oilseeds, pulses, orchards and other crops useful to 
            bees and benefitted by bee pollination. In addition, there is about 60 million hectares of forest area with beekeeping potential. 
            This vast area of agriculture and forest may easily sustain at least one crore bee colonies.<br></br>
